how our backend works
Login with College ID

Submit Complaint Anonymously

Receive Unique Complaint ID
After submission, you will get a unique Complaint ID. This ID is the only way to track your complaint's progress.

Track Your Complaint
Use your Complaint ID to check the status of your complaint at any time without logging in again.

Chat for Assistance
Students can use the in-app chat feature to ask questions or clarify details with the admin regarding their complaint.

Admin Support
Admins can review complaints, assign actions, and respond to queries through chat for smooth resolution.
